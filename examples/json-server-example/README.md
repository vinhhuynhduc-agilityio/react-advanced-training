## JSON Server

`json-server` is a simple and powerful tool for creating a mock REST API using a JSON file as the database. It is particularly useful for prototyping, testing, and developing front-end applications without the need for a real backend server.

### Command

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
